## How to play

You must get the bug to cross the sidewalk, in which there will be walkers. In addition, you can see different gems "walking" that will add 50 points. In case some walker steps you, you will return to your initial site and the score will go to 0. If you get to the water zone, you will be added 100 extra points.

To move around the screen, you have to use the arrows.

Do your best to go to the water and do not let walkers step you!
